The woman called earlier. She was complaining about a clown. She asked the clown to come to her kid's birthday
but he never showed up and he isn't answering any calls. She wants the detective to track down the clown and get
him (or maybe the clown should actually be a beautiful woman) to show up to the party for her freaking kid, all right?

so locations to look at the for the clown:

the park (also where the party is)
 --the amphitheater
 --picnic area (party location)
 --generic park

the bar (where the clown eventually is)
	--Main bar
	--further down the bar (clown drinking, looking sad)
		detective gives an encouraging talk about overcoming insecurities

the mall (there is nothing important at the mall)




Retrieve the famous painting (the scream parody)

location:

boardwalk, at sunset
